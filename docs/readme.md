#### Darkmode
Bootstrap5 darkmode can be enabled simply by setting the theme at the top of the html:
`<html lang="en" data-bs-theme="light">`


#### Development
For development, use a simple webserver that reloads whenever changes are made to the html/css,
like https://github.com/thanethomson/httpwatcher or similar.
